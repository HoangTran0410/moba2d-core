/**
 * The reference pack's own map, and what it is for beyond being playable.
 *
 * It is core's second, independent map fixture: twelve nav/lane/muster tests
 * lean on one big pack map's polygon soup, and the `NavGrid` clearance bug this
 * project shipped once only ever surfaced because a jungle had 60-90px gaps. So
 * what is asserted here is not decoration — a corridor in that same hostile
 * band, walls on all four edges, and a route across the whole map for a body of
 * real radius.
 *
 * The map behind it changed (a hand-drawn ARAM replaced a hand-*written*
 * Proving Grounds), and the fixture value had to survive that, so the cases
 * below **measure** rather than restate numbers somebody chose:
 * `wallGapWidths` finds the narrowest corridors the rasteriser will actually
 * see, and the symmetry case carries a tolerance because a map drawn by hand is
 * near-symmetric, not exactly so. A case that asserted "the gap is 80" would
 * have been a case that could only ever be deleted.
 *
 * See `packs/reference/map.ts` and `packs/reference/aramGeometry.ts` for what
 * it is; this file is what proves it is that, rather than merely looking like
 * it on paper.
