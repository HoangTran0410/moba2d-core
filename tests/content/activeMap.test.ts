 * A pack's geometry data may not overwrite core's record of what a map is.
 *
 * Found in the field, on a published pack, and it cost the whole map:
 * `@moba2d/content-riot`'s Twisted Treeline chunk begins `{"id":
 * "map-nhap-vao", "name": "Twisted Treeline", …}` — the id it was drawn under
 * in the editor, left in the export. Both call sites built the active map as
 * `{ ...summary, ...geometry }`, so that id won, `Game.activeMapId` became a
 * name nothing else in the system knows, and a client sent that name in the
 * hello could not find it in a catalogue holding `lol:twisted-treeline`. A
 * host on that map could not be joined at all.
 *
 * The type system cannot see any of this — `id` is not a field of
 * `MapGeometry`, so the spread was well-typed — which is exactly why the check
 * is a test and the guard is the construction.
