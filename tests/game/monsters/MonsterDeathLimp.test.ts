/**
 * What a camp with a procedural body does after it dies.
 *
 * Before this, nothing: `Monster.draw` returned on `isDead` and the body was
 * gone on the frame it lost its last health. That is fine for a sprite, which
 * reads as a pickup blinking out, and wrong for a rig — eight legs planted on
 * the ground do not blink out, and a body that plainly *was* standing there
 * suddenly not being there reads as a rendering fault rather than as a death.
 *
 * The timing constant is imported, so retuning the fade is not editing a test.
