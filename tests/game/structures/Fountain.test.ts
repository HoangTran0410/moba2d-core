   * The ring that says how far the shop reaches.
   *
   * Nothing in a match said it. On the default map that was fine — the reach
   * *is* the platform, and the platform is drawn — but a map that widens it
   * (`FountainStats.shopRange`) left a player to learn the rule by opening the
   * shop and reading whether the tiles were grey. The reported version of that:
   * "in-game cũng không có visual gì biết tầm mua đồ tới đâu".
   *
   * A ring is the obvious fix and clutter is the obvious objection, so what is
   * asserted here is the three gates that answer the objection. The drawing
   * itself is p5 calls and no test runs those; `shopRingAlpha` is the decision,
   * split out so it can be one.
