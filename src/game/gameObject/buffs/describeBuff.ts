/**
 * What a buff does, in the words a spell description would use.
 *
 * ## The gap this fills
 *
 * `Buff.description` has existed and been rendered by the HUD's hover panel
 * for as long as the panel has; not one buff in core or in either installed
 * pack ever set it. So the row under the portrait said "Bùa Xanh · còn 62
 * giây" and stopped there — the name and the clock, which are the two things
 * a player can already work out, and nothing about the blessing itself. Six
 * unlabelled icons is a row you can only learn by having been hit by each of
 * them once and remembering the picture.
 *
 * ## Why most of it is derived rather than written
 *
 * A control effect's whole meaning is the flags it sets, and those flags are
 * read by exactly one function — `Stats.updateActionState`, now asking
 * `deniesMovement` / `deniesCasting` / `deniesAttacking` on `StatusFlags`.
 * Asking the same three predicates here means the sentence cannot drift from
 * the mechanic: add `Rooted` to a buff and its tooltip gains "không thể di
 * chuyển" the same frame the champion stops walking. A hand-written Vietnamese
 * copy of those lists would have been a second source of truth that fails
 * silently — it does not throw when it goes stale, it just lies.
 *
 * So the split is: **anything the flags already say is derived, anything
 * carrying a number is written by the buff that owns the number.** `Slow`
 * knows its percent, `Shield` its pool, `DamageOverTime` its tick; none of
 * those is recoverable from a flag and each is the whole point of its buff.
 *
 * ## Where it runs
 *
 * `Buff.activateBuff`, immediately after `onCreate` and only when the buff has
 * not set a description of its own. That is the one point where a buff is
 * fully built — callers set `percent`, `amount` and `bonuses` *after* the
 * constructor, which is why `onCreate` exists at all — and it is before the
 * first frame anything can hover it.
