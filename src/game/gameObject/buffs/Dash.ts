   * mid-flight no longer ends the flight. Almost every use of it in the packs
   * is a *displacement* saying "my own pull must not be cancelled by my own
   * slow", which is a different sentence from the one a charge wants.
   *
   * What it never covered is the case a charge actually meets: **a
   * displacement is another `Dash`**. `buffAddType` is `REPLACE_EXISTING` and
   * `stackId` is the constructor, so a pull landing on a champion mid-charge
   * shares the charge's stack and `addBuff` deactivates the charge to make room
   * for it — no interrupt check involved, nothing asked. Reported from a real
   * match: an ultimate whose card promised "không thể cản phá bởi các hiệu ứng
   * khống chế" was stopped dead by an enemy's drag and again by their throw,
   * both of which are that shape, as is every other pull, knockback and throw
   * in every pack.
   *
   * So this one refuses a foreign `Dash` outright (`blocksIncoming`) *and*
   * implies the older flag. It lasts precisely as long as the flight does — the
   * buff ends on arrival — so it is the charge that is unstoppable, never the
