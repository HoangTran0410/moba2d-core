   * repeat the retrieve-then-`pointPolygon` pair that `update()` does inline
   * for the champion pass. A camp that has to stay in the river is the second
   * caller, so the pair becomes a method rather than a second copy.

   * A 1px query circle rather than the bare point: `Quadtree.retrieve` takes
   * an area, and a zero-sized one sits exactly on cell boundaries, where which
   * cell it lands in is a rounding question. One pixel of slop costs nothing —
   * the answer is decided by `pointPolygon` on the real vertices afterwards,
   * not by which cells came back.
   *
   * Obstacle vertices are already in world space (see the constructor: every
   * `Obstacle` is built at the origin), which is why there is no position
   * offset here and none in `update()` either.
