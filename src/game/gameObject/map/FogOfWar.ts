// polygon never drift apart. That's affordable because computeSightPoly's
// cost splits cleanly in two:
//   1. which obstacles are in vision range, and the broken (non-intersecting)
//      segment list built from them — this is the O(n^2) part
//      (PolyVisibility.breakIntersections) — only changes when the unit
//      crosses into a new neighbourhood of walls/bushes, so it's cached per
//      unit (see SightCacheEntry.segments/obstacleSignature) and reused
//      across frames until that set turns over;
//   2. the radial sweep against the exact source point
//      (PolyVisibility.computeViewport) depends on the unit's live position
//      and must run every frame for the fog to track it smoothly — it's the
//      O(n) part, and it's what actually runs unconditionally below.
// A unit that hasn't moved at all since last frame (exact position/radius
// equality) skips both and returns last frame's polygon outright, so a
// standing unit — every turret, all match long — still costs nothing.
//
// Every revealer casts one of these polygons, champion or not. Minions and
// turrets were painted as plain discs for a long time on the grounds that an
// ally swarm should cost a fill each rather than a raycast each — and the disc
// reached straight through walls and bushes, so a lane's fog looked as if the
// wave could see into the jungle while `combat/Vision.ts` had already decided
// it could not. Two things pay for the polygons instead: only revealers *near
// the camera* get one at all (see calculateSight), and a granted revealer's
// "hasn't moved" test carries a tolerance rather than demanding exact equality
// (GRANTED_SIGHT_TOLERANCE_PX), because nobody is steering a minion's fog.

   * overlay, an `erase` of every polygon, and the `image()` blit back — and a
   * CPU profile charged 82% of every `drawImage` in the game to that blit.
   * The constructor records why a smaller overlay is not the answer (a
   * resample is slower than a copy). This is: no overlay at all, so one pass
   * where there were three, at the price of the gradient rim — which is why
   * it is the stressed tier's picture and not everyone's.
   *
   * ## One clip per hole, not one path with every hole in it
   *
   * This used to build a single path — the viewport rectangle, then every
   * sight polygon wound the other way — and fill it `nonzero`, on the written
   * argument that the rule "leaves the union of the holes clear however many
   * of them overlap". **That argument is wrong, and it is the bug this path
   * shipped with.** A winding number is arithmetic, not a union: a point
   * inside the rectangle and inside *one* hole scores `+1 - 1 = 0` and is
   * left clear, and a point inside *two* scores `+1 - 1 - 1 = -1`, which is
   * not zero, so it is painted. Wherever two allies' vision overlapped — a
   * champion beside its own turret, anything at all near the fountain — the
   * fog came back, hard-edged, in the exact shape of the intersection.
   * Even-odd does the same thing one crossing later; no fill rule turns N
   * overlapping subpaths into their union.
   *
   * So the subtraction happens in the clip stack instead, where intersection
   * is what the operation *means*. Holes are grouped so that nothing in a
   * group overlaps anything else in it — the winding argument *is* sound for
   * disjoint holes — and each group clips to "the viewport minus these holes".
   * `ctx.clip` intersects those regions for us, and the intersection of every
   * complement is the complement of the union, which is the region the fog
   * belongs in. A frame whose revealers are spread out is one group: one
   * rectangle, one clip, one fill, the same work the broken version did. Only
   * a cluster standing on top of itself pays a clip per hole.
   *
   * `PolyVisibility`'s sweep does not promise an orientation, so each
   * polygon's is measured (`signedArea`) and reversed when it matches the
   * rectangle's.
   *
   * ## Why the polygon is cut to a circle first
   *
   * `computeSightPoly` clips its sweep to a **square** box reaching `radius`
   * out on every side (see `boxRadius` there), so the polygon it returns runs
   * to `1.41 × radius` in its own corners. The soft path never shows that: its gradient is
   * fully transparent past `radius`, so the corners erase nothing. This path
   * has no gradient — it would cut the corners out at full strength, and every
   * revealer's hole would be a square with straight edges slicing across its
   * neighbours. `clipPolygonToCircle` puts the rim back where the soft path
   * draws it. Done here rather than in `computeSightPoly` so the soft path's
   * geometry is untouched — it pays no vertices for a rim it already fades.

 * A polygon cut down to what fits inside a circle, with the circle's own rim
 * standing in for the parts that did not.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * `computeSightPoly` sweeps against a **square** clip box, so a revealer's
 * polygon reaches `1.41 x radius` into its corners. The soft path hides that
 * behind a gradient that is already transparent by `radius`; `drawDirect` has
 * no gradient and would cut the square out at full strength. This is the cut
 * that puts the boundary back on the circle.
 *
 * ## The shape of the walk
 *
 * Every edge is one of four cases — both ends in, leaving, entering, or a
 * chord straight across the disc from outside — and the only interesting one
 * is what happens *between* leaving and entering again: the boundary follows
 * the circle, so the rim is emitted there, in the direction the polygon itself
 * is wound. `atan2` increases along a positively-signed loop in screen
 * coordinates (y down), so that direction is one sign read off `signedArea`.
 *
 * The walk starts at a vertex **inside** the circle, which is what makes it
 * close itself: every run outside is then bracketed by an exit and an entry
 * within one lap, including the run that wraps past the end of the array.
 * Nothing inside at all is not a failure — the polygon is cast from this very
 * centre and is star-shaped about it, so it means the disc sits wholly inside
 * the polygon and the answer is the whole disc.
