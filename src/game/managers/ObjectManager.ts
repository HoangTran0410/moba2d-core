   *     thrown down an empty lane still bursts — and each builds its blast
   *     object there. Built outside the bracket, that object's own
   *     `attributedTo` is stamped `null` (`SpellObject`'s field initialiser
   *     reads the ambient), so the blast it later deals is not ability damage
   *     to `abilityPowerScales()` and `Stats.abilityPower` is dropped on the
   *     floor. A throw that *hit* somebody was amplified and the identical
   *     throw that landed on the ground was not.
   *   - `onAdded` is where an effect that acts on arrival acts. Damage dealt
   *     from there lost the same multiplier, in the same silence: a pack
   *     moving a bite from its update clock to its arrival — a legitimate
   *     change, and the fix for a 180ms gap between a burst and its number —
   *     took a champion from 449 damage to 31 with the tooltip still promising
   *     the 449.
   *
   * Neither had anything to do with what the pack wrote. The rule is a
   * property of *where core calls in*, so it belongs on every door core opens,
   * and having exactly one helper is what stops the next door from missing it.
