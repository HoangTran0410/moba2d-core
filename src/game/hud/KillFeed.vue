/**
 * The kill callouts and the banner, one component for both HUD layouts.
 *
 * Top centre, like the game this one is inspired by: the newest callout
 * lands under the top edge and pushes the older ones down; a banner for the
 * moments worth shouting sits beneath the stack. Pure display — everything
 * it shows is decided in `hudState`'s `buildFeed` (who is ally, which badges,
 * which colour family, how faded, whose kill), so this file has no game
 * import and no opinion. Mounted from `InGameHUD.vue` beside the death
 * recap, hidden with the corner cluster when a panel takes the corner.
 *
 * **A row is a run, not a kill** (`hud/killFeedGroups.ts`): one killer, then
 * every face they took down. Two `transition-group`s, nested, are what makes
 * that read as an update rather than a new callout — the outer one is keyed
 * on the row's opening kill, so a growing run is the same node and never
 * re-enters, and the inner one animates only the face just added.
 *
 * The names go once there is more than one victim. Five of them never fit a
 * phone's top edge, and the row that tried was the row that had to be capped
 * at three and then two — the faces are what a player reads at a glance
 * anyway, and the badge already says how many.
 *
 * Past five faces the row counts instead of drawing (`MAX_FEED_VICTIMS`): a
 * ten-kill run was 755px wide on a 692px window and lost both its ends to the
 * clip, the killer's own face among them. Newest face first, so the run's
 * older kills are the ones that fall into the count.
 *
 * A badge's word is wrapped rather than left bare so a narrow window can drop
 * it (`hud.css`) and keep the icon: the colour and the glyph already say which
 * kind of moment it was, and the row losing its left end costs far more.
 *
 * An objective row — a turret, an epic camp — has no portrait to put on the
 * right, so the glyph for its kind stands in for one and the name is kept.
 *
 * ## What stops it stacking on itself
 *
 * Three things, all of which only showed up when kills came faster than a row
 * lives — a 1v10 practice fight, which is what this room is for:
 *
 *  - **The stack is capped here, not in `hud.css`.** `nth-child` counts the
 *    rows *leaving* too, so a ghost sitting at the top of the list pushed a
 *    live row past the cap and blanked it for the length of a fade. A number
 *    the template slices by cannot miscount.
 *  - **A leaving row is pinned where it died.** `.kill-feed-leave-active` takes
 *    it out of flow, and an out-of-flow child of a centred flex column has its
 *    static position at the *top* of that column — so every ghost teleported
 *    onto the newest callout and faded there, two rows deep. `pinLeaving`
 *    writes the offsets it already had before the class lands.
 *  - **The banner is one element, not a queue of them.** See below.
