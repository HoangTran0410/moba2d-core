/**
 * The seam that made one match-config panel possible.
 *
 * There used to be two panels — the pregame setup screen over `localStorage`
 * and the in-game practice panel over `MatchDirector` — and they disagreed
 * about which settings existed at all: the setup screen alone could pick an
 * input mode, the panel alone could assign sides or switch the jungle off.
 * Neither was a superset. Two backends had grown two independent sets of
 * controls over the same config, and every new control landed in whichever
 * component its author happened to be editing.
 *
 * So the panel is one component now, and *this* is what it talks to. Two
 * implementations satisfy it: `PregameConfigSource` (no match exists;
 * everything is a read and a write of the stored config) and
 * `MatchDirectorSource` (a match is running; every mutation goes through
 * `MatchDirector`, which applies it and then persists it). A control added to
 * the panel has to be served by both, and the contract suite checks that it is.
 *
 * ## Nothing from the running game crosses this boundary
 *
 * No `Champion`, no `Spell`, no `Camera` — only view models and ids. That is
 * not tidiness, it is what keeps the panel out of the `game` chunk: the menu
 * mounts this same panel, and one value import of a `src/game/` runtime symbol
 * would put the whole match — every spell, the navigation grid, ~2MB — in
 * front of the logo. It is the same rule `game/input/touchPreferences.ts` was
 * split out to obey, and `tests/scenes/matchConfigChunk.test.ts` is what stops
 * it being quietly broken. Type-only imports are erased and are fine.
 *
 * ## `live` is the one capability flag
 *
 * A row carries no reference to a unit, because whether the live-only controls
 * render is a property of the *source*, not of a row: in a match every
 * participant is live, outside one none is. So `source.live !== null` is the
 * single gate, and the things that genuinely need a running match — KDA, refill,
 * clear cooldowns, stack counts, the camera zoom — hang off `MatchLiveControls`
 * where the type system can see they are unavailable.
 *
 * ## `canEditMatchSettings` is the second one, and it is about *whose* match
 *
 * `live` asks whether a match exists. This asks whether this device owns the
 * one that does. On a LAN client it is false, and every write that changes the
 * shared match — the rules, the world, the map, the cheats, the reset that
 * rewrites all three — refuses. It is a plain boolean rather than a nullable
 * group like `live` because the controls it gates are spread across two tabs
 * and are the *same* controls a host uses: a client should see the match's real
 * CDR and read that the jungle is on, greyed out, not find the rows missing.
