/**
 * What a participant did this match.
 *
 * Before this the game kept exactly one number about anybody — `Champion.score`,
 * `++` on a kill and `--` on a death — so 3 kills and 3 deaths was indexed the
 * same as never having fought. Minions and camps were credited to nobody at
 * all, which meant "farm" was not a quantity this game had, and damage was not
 * one either: the single most useful number for answering "is this new ability
 * tuned right" was thrown away every frame it was computed.
 *
 * Kept on `AttackableUnit` rather than on `Champion`, because the crediting
 * happens in `takeDamage` and `die` — both of which live on the base — and
 * because a turret's damage output is a real question. `score` stays a *view*
 * of two of these so the number painted on the health bar keeps meaning what it
 * has always meant.
 *
 * A match total, deliberately: nothing here is reset on death or respawn.
