/**
 * The on-hit pipeline: what runs when a basic attack actually lands.
 *
 * `EventType.ON_ATTACK_HIT` already exists and stays what it is — a global
 * *observation* seam, fired once per landed swing for anything watching the
 * whole match (a spell that re-arms itself off a landed swing, an e2e
 * counter). What it cannot carry is the item economy's on-hit family, because
 * those effects need each other: a phantom-hit passive re-applies *everyone
 * else's* on-hit effects, a side-bolt passive applies them to a second and
 * third victim, and a doubling passive echoes each application once more. A
 * crowd of independent global listeners has no way to say "run all of you
 * again, at that unit, but without re-triggering the ones that got us here".
 *
 * So on-hit effects are a *unit-local* walk instead: every buff on the
 * attacker gets `Buff.onHit(hit)`, in insertion order. An item passive hangs a
 * permanent buff (the `Item_Thornmail` shape) and that buff is the effect;
 * anything else that grants an on-hit — a champion passive, a temporary
 * steroid — is a buff already.
 *
 * ## `echo`, and who checks it
 *
 * A **propagator** is an effect that calls `applyOnHitEffects` itself: a
 * phantom hit, a side bolt, a doubler. Every propagator marks the application
 * it starts with `echo: true` and refuses to act on one — that pair of rules
 * is what makes any *set* of propagators terminate: an echo can only come
 * from a real swing, never from another echo, so the chain is at most two
 * deep per victim. Plain payloads (bonus damage, a heal, a mana refund)
 * ignore `echo` and simply run again, which is what being doubled means.
 *
 * `MAX_ONHIT_DEPTH` is the belt over those braces: a pack author who forgets
 * the `echo` check has written an infinite loop, and a frozen tab is the
 * worst possible way to find that out. The latch turns it into an effect that
 * quietly stops compounding past a depth no legitimate stack reaches.
