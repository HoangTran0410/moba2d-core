 * abstraction as a lie instead — a map author writes `factions` and never
 * touches `TeamId`, so the vocabulary has to be exactly as free as
 * `Faction.id` already promises it is.
 *
 * A third-or-later faction (or a slot naming one `validate.ts` never saw,
 * which cannot happen on an installed pack but costs nothing to guard here
 * too) falls through to `undefined`, the same "isolated object" default
 * every other unbound `teamId` gets (`GameObject.teamId`'s own fresh-uuid
