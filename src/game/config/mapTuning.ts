 * Where a map's numbers meet core's, and the only place they do.
 *
 * ## Three layers, innermost wins
 *
 * ```
 * core default  →  map.tuning.<system>  →  slot.stats
 * ```
 *
 * A monster has a fourth, outermost layer — the pack's own `MonsterBody` —
 * which is why the map layer scales it rather than replacing it: a map cannot
 * know what will fill its slots. Everything else starts from a constant in
 * this repository that a map author can go and read, so those layers are
 * plain overrides.
 *
 * ## Why this is its own module
 *
 * `preset.ts` is 900 lines and its job is *slots to presets*. The arithmetic
 * of merging three layers is a different job with a different test shape —
 * plain objects in, plain objects out, no p5 globals, no `Game`, no content
 * registry — so it is testable on its own and every caller composes tuning
 * through these functions rather than reaching into `MapTuning` by hand.
 *
 * ## The rule every function here keeps
 *
 * **An absent field resolves to what core did before `MapTuning` existed.**
 * `resolve*(undefined, ...)` must reproduce today's numbers exactly, which is
 * what makes "every existing map plays identically" a thing a test can assert
 * once per system instead of a claim.
