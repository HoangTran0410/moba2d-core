/**
 * Match modes: a name for a bundle of knobs the panel already has.
 *
 * ## What a mode is not
 *
 * Not a win condition, not a queue, not a map. This game is a practice room —
 * the match ends when the player leaves it — so a "mode" here is the answer
 * to "how do I want tonight's room set up", stated once instead of dragged
 * across four controls and two tabs. URF is CDR at 80% with mana off; the
 * brawl is every kit random with no way home; the duel is one bot. Every one
 * of those was already possible; none of them had a name.
 *
 * ## Macro, then overlay
 *
 * Picking a mode does two different kinds of thing, and the split is the
 * design:
 *
 * - **Knobs the panel owns are written through the panel.** `rules`, `world`
 *   and `bots` are copied into `PregameConfig` by `applyMode` (outside a
 *   match) or seeded into the live match by `MatchDirector.setMode` (inside
 *   one). Afterwards the fields are the truth and the mode id is a label —
 *   see `modeDrift`, which is how the label admits it has been edited.
 * - **Numbers no knob holds ride on the id.** `tuning` is laid over the map's
 *   own `MapTuning` when the match boots (`mergeTuning`, in `Game`'s
 *   constructor), and `allRandom` is read by `planMatchKits`. Both take effect
 *   on the next match, like the map choice does, and for the same reason: a
 *   running match cannot change its economy or re-roll its roster.
 *
 * `MapTuning` is the right vehicle for the second half because it already
 * has the levers a mode wants — starting gold, income, respawn, champion
 * speed — and every reader resolves `game.mapTuning` at the moment it needs
 * it, so a merged object reaches all of them without a single new seam.
 *
 * ## Pure data
 *
 * Imports types only. `PregameConfig.ts` imports `isMatchModeId` from here as
 * a value, so a value import in the other direction would be a cycle
 * evaluated at module load — which is why `classic.bots` is a literal rather
 * than `DEFAULT_PREGAME_CONFIG.ai.count` (`matchModes.test.ts` pins them
 * equal). Safe to import from the menu chunk for the same reason
 * `PregameConfig.ts` is.
