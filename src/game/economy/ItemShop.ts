/**
 * Buying and selling, and the rules about where.
 *
 * ## At your own fountain — or dead
 *
 * The owner's call, and it is the rule both games this engine's players have
 * played use, both halves of it. Standing at your own fountain is what gives
 * going home a price: without it recall is a movement ability and nothing
 * more, and a player who never leaves the lane is strictly ahead of one who
 * does. And a death timer is shopping time — death *satisfies* the location
 * rule rather than adding a refusal on top of it, so a corpse buys and sells
 * from wherever it fell and respawns already carrying what its gold was for.
 * The respawn counter is the one stretch a player is guaranteed to be
 * reading the shop instead of the fight.
 *
 * ## Why `refusalFor` answers with a reason
 *
 * A bare `false` leaves the panel greying a button out for reasons the player
 * has to guess — and the four reasons want four different sentences ("chưa đủ
 * vàng", "túi đã đầy", "phải về bệ đá"). One function answers which rule said
 * no, and `buyItem` is that same function plus the mutation, so the two can
 * never disagree about what is allowed.
 *
 * ## Nothing half-happens
 *
 * `buyItem` checks everything first and only then touches the wallet and the
 * inventory. The specific failure it is written against is `NOT_LOADED`: a
 * spell class arrives through a dynamic import, an item is bought *once* and
 * held for the rest of the match, and selling the player an inert copy of the
 * thing they wanted — because a chunk had not landed yet — is the one failure
 * here with no way back.
 */

/**
 * What selling gives back, as a fraction of what was paid.
 *
 * Deliberately not 1. A full refund turns an inventory into a set of free stat
 * toggles — buy the armour for this fight, sell it for the damage next fight,
 * pay nothing ever — and a purchase stops being a decision. Deliberately not 0
 * either: a player who buys the wrong thing early should be able to correct
 * it at a cost rather than carry the mistake for the whole match.

 * whose components are simply not in the bag — both are "this is an ordinary
 * purchase" and both callers treat them the same way.
 *
 * ## Why the matching is written out rather than done with a Set
 *
 * A recipe may name the same component twice, and it may name one the bag
 * holds three of. The obvious `held.filter(item => recipe.includes(item.id))`
 * gets both wrong in opposite directions: it consumes all three spares, and it
 * resolves both halves of a doubled recipe to whichever copy it met first —
 * billing the player for two longswords and taking one. So each entry claims
 * one slot, and a claimed slot is out of the running for the entries after it.
 *
 * ## One level deep, deliberately
 *
 * A recipe naming `berserkers_greaves` is **not** satisfied by holding the
 * `boots` that greaves are built from. That reads like a missing recursion and
 * is the rule both games this engine's players have played use: you buy the
 * intermediate item — which credits the boots at *that* purchase — and the
 * intermediate is then what the next tier consumes. Crediting transitively
 * would let a bag of six cheap components collapse into a top-tier item in one
 * click, which deletes the build path the recipe exists to draw. The total
 * spent is identical either way; only the number of decisions changes.
 *
 * The *display* tree in `shopState.recipeTree` does descend several levels, on
 * purpose: what a part is eventually made of is worth reading, and is a
 * different question from what this purchase consumes. Do not reconcile the
 * two. `itemRecipes.test.ts` pins both halves.

 * champion on death did not decide to abandon its build — the match took the
