/**
 * The About screen's content: what the game is, a link to the source, any
 * write-ups about the project, and a player-facing changelog.
 *
 * **What a content pack is, and how to install one, is not here.** It was,
 * and it made this screen twice as long while putting the explanation one
 * scene away from the buttons that act on it. It lives on the packs screen
 * now, which is where a player who wants to know is already standing; this
 * screen keeps one sentence and a button through to it.
 *
 * One scrollable panel rather than a tabbed one (contrast
 * `MatchConfigPanel.vue`): three short, read-only sections fit a single
 * scroll without needing per-section state to survive a re-mount, so a tab
 * bar here would only add a click between them for no control gained.
 *
 * `CHANGELOG` (`./about/changelog.ts`) and `ARTICLES` (`./about/articles.ts`)
 * are plain data — no `src/game/` import, see their own file comments and
 * `tests/scenes/aboutBootPath.test.ts` — and are the two files meant to be
 * edited directly, including by someone who does not read the rest of this
 * component.
 *
 * No hand-rolled touch scrolling here, unlike `MatchConfigPanel`'s tabs: that
 * machinery exists because the practice panel is also mounted *inside*
 * `#game-scene`, under `touch-action: none` (see `styles/game-scene.css`),
 * where a plain scroll container fights the canvas for the gesture. This
 * screen mounts over `#about-scene`, a sibling of `#game-scene` reached only
 * from the menu — no p5 canvas exists yet, `GameScene.syncTouches` only ever
 * claims touches whose target *is* that canvas (see its own comment), and
 * `body { overflow: hidden }` is the only ancestor rule in play. Plain
 * `overflow-y: auto` on `.about-body` is therefore the whole of the fix.
