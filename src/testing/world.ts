/**
 * The observer's half of core's public surface.
 *
 * `ContentApi` is what a *spell* sees: it is handed a world and acts on it.
 * This is what an *observer* sees: it builds a world, runs it, and reads the
 * result. Two roles, two doors, and neither is a place to leak core internals
 * through — if this module becomes a re-export barrel for `src/game/`, then
 * changing `AttackableUnit` is a breaking change for every pack again, just
 * through the back door.
 *
 * Moved here from `tests/game/fixtures.ts` unchanged. It lives in `src/`
 * rather than `tests/` because a separated pack's test files must be able to
 * reach it by package name, and `files` in `package.json` ships `src`.

 *
 * Eight core test files used a riot-pack-specific monster art key here, chosen without meaning to:
 * batch 4 task 4 moved that art into `packs/riot/assets/`, so every one of them silently required
 * that pack to be installed to test a core mechanic that has nothing to do with it.
 * Content-pack-extraction batch 5 task 8's departure drill is what made it visible — an
 * unknown-asset-key error, 24 failures across six files, none of them about monsters, minions or
 * turrets being wrong.
 *
 * `'other_logo'` is core's own, in `src/generated/assetManifest.ts`, and is
 * there in every checkout by construction. Any core key would do; what
 * matters is that it is not a pack's.

/**
 * Gives `game` a terrain map with real walls at `polygons`, in world
 * coordinates.
 *
 * A stub that only answered `getObstaclesInArea` used to be enough, because
 * every spell read the polygons directly. They read `TerrainField` now — a
 * signed distance field baked from the wall layer, so that a wall chopped into
 * convex pieces stops having seams anything can fall between — and a field has
 * to be built rather than faked. `getObstaclesInArea` is still answered for the
 * parts of the game that legitimately want polygons: the draw pass, the fog and
 * the bush/water tests.
 *
 * Two ways this is not the real `TerrainMap`, both fine for what tests ask of
 * it and both worth knowing before writing an assertion against them:
 *
 * - **The grid only covers [0, mapSize].** A polygon reaching outside is clipped
 *   to it, so a wall drawn across the axis is only half there. Keep what a test
 *   asserts inside the box.
 * - **`getObstaclesInArea` ignores its `area`** and hands back every polygon.
 *   Wider than the real one, never narrower, which is the safe direction for a
 *   caller that filters afterwards. The `type` is real, so a `TerrainType`
 *   filter works — without it the layer reads as empty to anything that filters,
 *   which is a way to write a test that passes for the wrong reason.
