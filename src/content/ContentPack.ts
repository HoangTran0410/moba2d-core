 * What a content pack is, and why the code half is a function.
 *
 * A pack's contract splits into a data half (`ContentPackData` — manifest,
 * champions, spell display, monsters, maps: read to draw a picker) and a code
 * half (`ContentPackCode` — spells, monster abilities: real engine classes).
 * `ContentPack`, the union every existing reader still names, is their
 * intersection.
 *
 * The code half stays a factory taking core's API, because the alternative is
 * a pack that bundles its own copy of `Spell`, `SpellObject` and the buffs —
 * and then there are two classes of every name in the process. `instanceof`
 * stops answering, `Z_INDEX_MAP` is looked up by base-class identity so a
 * pack's spell object matches no key and falls to z-index 99 on top of every
 * champion, and the buff registry exists twice. One core, handed in.
 *
 * The reason the split exists at all: reading a pack's *data* — its champion
 * list, a map to offer in a picker — used to mean building that whole engine
 * surface first, because the one function a pack exported needed the api to
 * run. A menu screen that only wants names and icons now never has to.
 *
 * The same shape also loads at runtime, which is the whole point:
 *
 *     Stage 1  import code from '@moba2d/content-lol'         -> code(api)
 *     Stage 2  const { default: code } = await import(url)     -> code(api)
 *
 * so batch 2 changes `install.ts` and nothing a pack author wrote.

   * `ChampionEntry.image`, `MonsterBody.avatar` and `SpellDisplayData.iconKey`
   * are each documented "pack-relative" — a bare, local key the pack author
   * writes without knowing what any other installed pack calls its own art
   * (`'champ_yasuo'`, never `'riot:champ_yasuo'`). Two packs can each declare
   * a champion whose portrait is locally `'hero'`, and nothing before this
   * field told those two apart: both keys landed in one flat `AssetManager`

   * qualified form against exactly the one pack's own registered asset
   * manifest — see `AssetManager.registerPackAssets`'s own doc comment for

   * convention (say, folding the base into the key string by hand, the way
   * `packs/reference/spells/*.ts`'s `'reference_vera_q'` keys do today by
   * accident of their own folder name) was rejected on purpose: a codebase
   * with two ways to spell "which pack does this belong to" has neither.
   *
   * **Optional, not required, and the two states mean different things.**
   * `undefined` is not "this pack forgot to declare its assets" — it is
   * "this pack's `image`/`avatar`/`iconKey` strings, if it has any, are
   * already keys in *core's* flat namespace and must resolve there
   * unqualified." The reference pack is exactly this today: its five files
   * still live under core's own `assets/images/reference/`, so qualifying
   * its `iconKey`s here would turn a working `'reference_vera_q'` into a
   * broken `'reference:reference_vera_q'` that resolves nowhere. Setting
   * this field is what a pack does *after* moving its art into its own tree
   * (`packs/<id>/assets/`, generated by `assets:generate --tree=<id>`) —
   * the League pack's own manifest sets `assets: 'lol'` for exactly that
   * reason, once its 378 files stopped living in core's tree.
   *
   * Always equal to `id` in every pack this repository ships. A pack's
   * asset namespace and its content namespace are the same question, and a
   * separately-settable string here would let a future pack quietly desync
   * them for no reason a reader could ever recover — this field exists

 * test for that is one assertion per system rather than a re-balanced suite.
 *
 * ## Why it lives on `MapSummary` and not in `MapGeometry`
 *
 * `ActiveMap = MapSummary & MapGeometry`, so `Game` and `preset.ts` receive
 * it with no change to that type; `PackRegistry.maps()` returns the summary,
 * so a picker can tell the player what is unusual about a map *before*
 * downloading its polygons; and a few hundred bytes has no business behind
 * the lazy geometry loader, where editing one number would invalidate a
 * cached chunk measured in hundreds of kilobytes.
