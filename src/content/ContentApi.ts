/**
 * Everything a content pack is allowed to touch.
 *
 * The size is measured, not chosen: the 241 spell files import 72 distinct
 * core modules between them, 110 symbols in total. Eight namespaces is what
 * turns that into a surface someone can read.
 *
 * The reason this is achievable at all is that `GameObject.game` was already
 * typed as `GameObjectGameContext` — a structural interface, not the `Game`
 * class — so the transitive closure of everything here stops at 87 modules and
 * touches `Game`, `SceneManager` and every Vue component exactly zero times.
 * Half of this seam was built before anyone set out to build it.
 *
 * `asset` takes a plain string on purpose. Core keeps its generated `AssetKey`
 * union for its own art; a pack declares its keys in its own manifest and
 * type-checks them against its own generated union. Type safety does not
 * vanish, it stops at the boundary — which is exactly where `validate.ts`
 * takes over.
 *
 * **A module import is not the same thing as the symbols a real spell needs
 * from it.** The first cut of this file imported the *default* of every
 * module the measured import table named and stopped there — but 8 of those
 * modules also carry named exports real spells import alongside the default
 * (`PredefinedParticleSystems` beside `ParticleSystem`, `createReveal` beside
 * `TrueSight`, and six more), and three more modules — `ObjectManager`
 * (`PredefinedFilters`, 153 files), `CancelPolicy` (`SpellForm`) and
 * `ai/SpellRole` — were not carried at all. This was `coreSpellsApiSurface.test.ts`'s
 * job before batch 4 task 3 (it kept it from silently narrowing again by
 * scanning every `@/` import in `spells/` and `coreSpells/`); now that
 * `packs/riot/spells/` cannot name a `@/` core module at all (the
 * `pack-core-boundary` seam), that scan's real population is `coreSpells/`
 * alone — see its own header for the renamed, narrower guarantee.
