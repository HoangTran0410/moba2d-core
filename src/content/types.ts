/**
 * Everything a content pack may import as a type.
 *
 * Types and values leave core by different doors, and the reason is what a
 * pack becomes: its own package, compiled against core's `.d.ts` and handed
 * core's runtime objects. A type-only import survives that intact — it is
 * erased before anything runs, so it creates no second copy of a class and no
 * `instanceof` that answers wrong. A *value* import would create exactly
 * those, which is why `ContentApi` exists and why nothing here is a value.
 *
 * So: `import type { CastContext } from '@/content/types'` is correct and
 * always will be; `import { Slow } from '@/game/gameObject/buffs/Slow'` is
 * not, and the `pack-core-boundary` seam fails the pack's own build over it.

/**
 * More type-only gaps, found the same way the rest of this barrel was:

 * first by reading the import surface directly, then by the compiler itself
 * once packs/riot/spells/ was real (each remaining `Cannot find name` under
 * `tsc -p tsconfig.strict-core.json` named one more). `ContentApi`-surface
 * checks (now `coreSpellsApiSurface.test.ts`) only ever asserted VALUE
 * coverage — its own doc comment says type-only imports are skipped, on
 * purpose, because a type is erased and has no runtime object to be
 * "reachable" through — so none of these ever had to justify themselves
 * against that scan. They still needed a home once packs/riot/spells/ could
 * no longer reach into core directly at all: `BasicAttackHit` is the
 * `ON_ATTACK_HIT` payload shape (15 files, all read-only);
 * `BasicAttackController` names the field a bot reads off
 * `this.owner.basicAttack` (one skillshot, purely as a cast target, never
 * constructed); `GameObjectRuntimeContext` is a lantern-throw ability's helper's `game`
 * parameter type; `KillCredit` is a clone spell's clone declaring how a kill on it
 * should be scored; `TargetingRequest` is the shape every `UNIT`-targeting
 * spell's `targetingRequest` field returns (20 files); the rest
 * (`ExecuteFallback`/`ExecuteSpell`, `DynamicWall`, `BeamGeometry`,
 * `WallContact`, `AssetHandle`) are one or two spells each, named in the
 * commit that added them rather than repeated here.

/**
 * The instance type of every class `api` hands out.
 *
 * A pack receives constructors — `api.Spell`, `api.buffs.Slow` — and needs
 * their *instance* types to write a field or a parameter. Without these it
 * derives each one itself, at the top of every file that wants one:
 *
 *     type AttackableUnit = InstanceType<ContentApi['units']['AttackableUnit']>;
 *
 * Measured on `@moba2d/content-lol`: 221 of those lines still being read
 * after the dead ones were deleted, spelling out 18 distinct types, 120 of
 * them that same `AttackableUnit`. Each is correct and each was invented
 * independently, which is the real cost — the shape of it teaches a new pack
 * author that naming a core type is supposed to be hard.
 *
 * **Derived from `ContentApi`, never re-exported from `@/game/...`.** A
 * direct re-export would be a second declaration of the same thing, free to
 * say something `api` does not the day a member is narrowed; deriving keeps
 * one source of truth and makes these strictly a shorter spelling of what a
 * pack would have written. It also adds no reach: every one of them was
 * already nameable through `ContentApi`, which this module already publishes.
 *
 * `tests/content/contentTypes.test.ts` pins the buff list against `BUFFS`
 * itself, so a new buff class cannot land without a pack being able to name
 * it.
